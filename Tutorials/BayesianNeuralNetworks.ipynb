    "This tutorial introduces the reader to the concept of Bayesian neural networks. A symbiosis between the extensive research done on neural networks, but where at the same time hyperparameters and \"prior\" knowledge are encoded in the setup of the weights, and Bayesian analysis, the study of the relation between our preconceptions and their change when confronted with new data. In its simplest form one would take distributions from our favorite package and put them over the weights of the neural network.\n",

    "As the search for a posterior does then, like in the probabilistic programming tutorial, rely on sampling-heavy routines the embedding of such Bayesian neural network inside of a PPL, such as Turing allows Turing's advanced inference algorithms to sample from the probabilistic model and obtain a posterior. We are at the same time faced with the same dilemma as in the amortized inference example; we need to evaluate our desire for accuracy against the available compute ressources and the desire to reduce the influence of priors' influence on the training outcome.\n",
